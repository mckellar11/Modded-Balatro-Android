# Balatro Mobile-EM-Edition (my initials) 
Fork of the original project by Blake502
Only forked because its easier for people to find. I did not change the mobile maker, I merely created a write up for what to do AFTER making the amk
after turning your STEAM copy into an android copy, these are added files to make everything easier because the wall of text in the github issues section is going to get someone lost. 

The goal of this project is simplify the installation of the modded *Balatro* apk  on their mobile devices and transfer their mods in the correct format.
Mods are not _officially_ supported, [but with my guide they are as easy to install as they are on PC](https://github.com/blake502/balatro-mobile-maker/issues/147#issuecomment-2652346316) 

**this link goes to my text writeup if you don't feel comfortable running my batch scripts^^**
The write up moves the files, the scripts copy/delete so the original are in tact. I may edit this guide to just copy solely

## How to Start 
From my write up at https://github.com/blake502/balatro-mobile-maker/issues/147#issuecomment-2652346316
Run the game with mods on PC. Get to the splash screen and ALT+F4 the game, as long as it loads up with the mods to the title you're good.
Run balatro-mobile-maker with your phone plugged in. create the apk using your preferences from the terminal. (dont worry about external storage patch)

 - Download  [**balatro-mobile-maker**](https://github.com/blake502/balatro-mobile-maker/releases).
 - Leave it in downloads. (For real it doesn't matter. It assumes Balatro is installed at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro)
 - Run **balatro-mobile-maker** from downloads folder
 ```

```
 ### For Android:
 The progrram will spit out a 'balatro.apk' into your downloads folder to which it will not delete if you choose to cleanup the files further into the mobile maker. 
 
 - if your mod folder is still in the "pc configuration" meaning you can run it on pc anytime you like without having to move/delete anything (no previous mobile maker formatting) then you should pause at the steam transfer stage and run the mobile makers save functions after the next few steps
 
 ## GETTING MODS IN ORDER 
 
 (I have created TWO batch scripts to do EXACTLY these steps and have verified on my own PERSONAL main pc. I recommend using them but here is the process)
 
- Open file explorer, navigate to `C:\Users\[YOURNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods\lovely\dump`

 - `CTRL+A` and then `CTRL+C` on the entire contents of the `\dump\` folder mentioned.

- go back to `C:\Users\[YOURNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\ `  `CTRL+V` all the files into that folder alongside/WITH the Mods folder not IN.
- The files `nativefs.lua` from `C:\Users\[YOURNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods\smods\libs\nativefs` and  `json.lua` from `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods\smods\libs\json` copy them to `C:\Users\[YOURNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Balatro` 
- Create a file in the same Balatro folder called "lovely.lua" and paste this  : 

```
 return {
  repo = "https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector",
  version = "0.7.1",
  mod_dir = "/data/data/com.unofficial.balatro/files/save/game/Mods",
}
```

I just changed the version to the latest and directed it to this folder which worked for me^^
- `ctrl+C`  the file  `version.lua` from your `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods\smods` then  the go to `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\Balatro` creating a few folder called `SMODS` all caps and paste the file into that SMODS folder. 

- Make sure you remember the [balatro mobile compat mod](https://github.com/eeve-lyn/BalatroMobileCompat)

IF YOU DON'T USE TALISMAN SKIP TO THE NEXT STEP AFTER THIS \/

- if you have any mods that use talisman then you need to create a folder under `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\`  called  `nativefs`  and  `CTRL+C`  the nativefs.lua from `C:\Users\Ethan\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods\Talisman`  into the new  `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\nativefs`  folder. 

*At this point, all of the files are in the correct location on PC. YOU SHOULD NOW BE READY TO TRANSFER YOUR SAVES FROM THE TERMINAL OF MOBILE MAKER.*

# This code could most likely be improved, which is what I am slowly trying to do
but if anyone wants to submit any PR's and you have more coding experience to make what i've done simpler, less parses, better regex then PLEASE let me know! or if you want to help create a mac version, or generic linux please dm me or again, submit a PR
